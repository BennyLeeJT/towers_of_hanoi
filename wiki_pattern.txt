Wiki explanation of the pattern:
Simpler statement of iterative solution

For an even number of disks:

make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs C and B (in either direction),
repeat until complete.


For an odd number of disks:

make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),
make the legal move between pegs C and B (in either direction),
repeat until complete.

In each case, a total of 2^n âˆ’ 1 moves are made.
